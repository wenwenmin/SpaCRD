# SpaCRD

## Introduction
Accurate detection of cancer tissue regions (CTR) enables deeper analysis of the tumor microenvironment and offers crucial insights into treatment response. Traditional CTR detection methods, which typically rely on the rich cellular morphology in histology images, are susceptible to a high rate of false positives due to morphological similarities across different tissue regions. The groundbreaking advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) provide detailed cellular phenotypes and spatial localization information, offering new opportunities for more accurate cancer region detection. However, current methods are unable to effectively integrate histology images with ST data, especially in the context of cross-sample and cross-platform/batch settings for accomplishing the CTR detection. To address this challenge, we propose SpaCRD, a transfer learning-based method that deeply integrates histology images and ST data to enable reliable CTR detection across diverse samples, platforms, and batches. Once trained on source data, SpaCRD can be readily generalized to accurately detect cancerous regions across samples from different platforms and batches. The core of SpaCRD is a category-regularized variational reconstruction-guided bidirectional cross-attention fusion network, which enables the model to adaptively capture latent co-expression patterns between histological features and gene expression from multiple perspectives. Extensive benchmark analysis on 23 matched histology-ST datasets spanning various disease types, platforms, and batches demonstrates that SpaCRD consistently outperforms existing eight state-of-the-art methods in CTR detection.
